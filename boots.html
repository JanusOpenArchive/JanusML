# *Boots* (Poem)
>We're foot—slog—slog—slog—slogging over Africa  
Foot—foot—foot—foot—slogging over Africa --  
(Boots—boots—boots—boots—moving up and down again!)  
There's no discharge in the war!  
Seven—six—eleven—five—nine-and-twenty mile to-day  
Four—eleven—seventeen—thirty-two the day before --  
(Boots—boots—boots—boots—moving up and down again!)  
There's no discharge in the war!  
Don't—don't—don't—don't—look at what's in front of you.  
(Boots—boots—boots—boots—moving up and down again);  
Men—men—men—men—men go mad with watching them,  
And there's no discharge in the war!  
Count—count—count—count—the bullets in the bandoliers.  
If—your—eyes—drop—they will get atop of you!  
(Boots—boots—boots—boots—moving up and down again) --  
There's no discharge in the war!  
We—can—stick—out—hunger, thirst, and weariness,  
But—not—not—not—not the chronic sight of them,  
Boot—boots—boots—boots—moving up and down again,  
And there's no discharge in the war!  
It—ain't—so—bad—by—day because of company,  
But night—brings—long—strings—of forty thousand million  
Boots—boots—boots—boots—moving up and down again.  
There's no discharge in the war!  
I—have—marched—six—weeks in Hell and certify  
It—is—not—fire—devils, dark, or anything,  
But boots—boots—boots—boots—moving up and down again,  
And there's no discharge in the war!  
Try—try—try—try—to think of something different  
Oh—my—God—keep—me from going lunatic!  
(Boots—boots—boots—boots—moving up and down again!)  
There's no discharge in the war!
