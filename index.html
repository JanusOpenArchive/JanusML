<!-- Original JanusML:
# JanusML
**JanusML** (short for **Janus Markup Language**) is a customized form of Markdown designed for use by [Evermore Publishing](https://evermorepublishing.pages.dev/) in our [WebPublish](https://evermorepublishing.pages.dev/works/) service. We originally started the project to help us format the articles for our WebPublish service (in the style of academic journals), but since we've seen it being used for help docs and more!

## Using JanusML
You can easily use JanusML via our [encoder](https://janusml.pages.dev/encoder/), which allows you to write Markdown and then transform it into HTML with our JanusML Design Library.

### Customization
If you want to customize JanusML to your liking, you can modify the [design theme](https://github.com/EvermorePublishing/JanusML-Theme/tree/main) on GitHub. Everything is made to be easy to change. Change colors, fonts, layouts and more!
